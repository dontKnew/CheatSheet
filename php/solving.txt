Problme 1 :  codeigniter 3 dataabase
	1. Select All invoice_payment table data
	2. foreach data one by one
	3. And Store in Array first Loop- invoice_payment.hotel_id & debit & update invoice_payment.debit=invoice_payment.balance 
	4. second loop - if invoice_payment.hotel_id exits in array then update invoice_payment.debit+stored-debit(balance amount)  in invoice_payment table & Update Array stored-debit = stored-debit+invoice_payment.debit
	Hint - its like ledger book debit & credit and i want to entry only debit here & balance will be plus with debit

Solved 1 : 
        $query = $this->db->get('invoice_payment');
        $invoice_payments = $query->result_array();
        
        $stored_debits = array();
        foreach ($invoice_payments as $invoice_payment) {
          if (array_key_exists($invoice_payment['hotel_id'], $stored_debits)) {
              
            $new_balance = $invoice_payment['debit'] + $stored_debits[$invoice_payment['hotel_id']];
            $this->db->set('balance', $new_balance);
            $this->db->where('id', $invoice_payment['id']);
            $this->db->update('invoice_payment');
            
            $stored_debits[$invoice_payment['hotel_id']] += $invoice_payment['debit'];
          } else {
            
            $stored_debits[$invoice_payment['hotel_id']] = $invoice_payment['debit'];
            
            $this->db->set('balance', $invoice_payment['debit']);
            $this->db->where('id', $invoice_payment['id']);
            $this->db->update('invoice_payment');
          }

	1. I have one table invoice
	2. select column item_data(which is in json format - select total_amount) from invoice table
	3. then update invoice_payment.debit=item_data(json_key - total_amount), invoice_payment.balance=item_data(json_key - total_amount),  invoice_payment.remark="auto entry", in invoice_payment whereas invoice_payment.invoice_id=invoice.id
		Ans : 
		UPDATE invoice_payment
		JOIN invoice ON invoice_payment.invoice_id = invoice.id
		SET invoice_payment.debit = JSON_EXTRACT(invoice.item_data, '$.total_amount'),
